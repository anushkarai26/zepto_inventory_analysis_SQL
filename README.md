## ‚úÖ C. Recommendations & Next Steps

### 1. üè¨ Inventory & Supply Chain Optimization

**For:** *Supply Chain & Inventory Teams*

* **Restock High-Demand, Out-of-Stock Products:**
  Replenish high-MRP and frequently bought SKUs currently out of stock, including:

  * Patanjali Cow Ghee
  * Mamypoko Pants
  * Aashirvaad Atta (Multigrains)
  * Everest Kashmiri Lal Chilli
    These items represent high potential revenue and their absence can impact customer retention and satisfaction.

* **Rationalize Bulky, Low-Revenue Categories:**
  Categories like *Fruits & Vegetables* contribute little to revenue but may occupy significant delivery or shelf space.

  * Downscale safety stock
  * Use smaller trucks for heavy but low-revenue routes
  * Review reorder points to prevent overstocking

---

### 2. üì£ Promotions & Marketing Strategy

**For:** *Marketing, Growth & Category Management Teams*

* **Showcase High-Discount SKUs in Campaigns:**
  Products with ‚â• 50% discount are ideal for:

  * Flash sale banners
  * Push notifications
  * ‚ÄúBest Deals‚Äù sections on the homepage
    These drive conversions among price-sensitive shoppers and improve discoverability.

* **Target Ad Spend Toward Elastic Categories:**
  Categories like:

### 3. üõí Product Mix & Pricing Strategy

* **Apply Weight-Based SKU Classification:**
  Use the Low/Medium/Bulk segmentation to:

  * Improve truckload planning
